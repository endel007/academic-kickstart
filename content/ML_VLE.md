abstract = "In this research, a method was developed to evaluate and predict the efficiency of small exporting companies
taking as input or asset variables the total assets, equity, total liabilities, operating expenses, sales costs and as output 
or result variables. net sales, net income and operating income. For this, the envelopment data analysis was used in 
the evaluation of the efficiency, the discriminant analysis in the evaluation of the classification of efficient and
inefficient companies and the artificial neural networks to evaluate its capacity of classification prediction in 90
companies of the sector of the city ​​of Barranquilla-Colombia. The results allowed to classify the companies according
to level of efficiency showing an average technical efficiency of 41.38% of the sector with 11 representative companies
of efficiency. The results show the relevance of the proposed methodology to correctly classify and forecast technical 
efficiency in small exporting companies."
