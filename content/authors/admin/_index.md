I am a full-time Professor of the Engineering Department at UTB (Technological University of Bolivar) in Cartagena - Colombia. At this moment I’m developing a PhD in Network and Information Technologies, my thesis topic is related to develop a recommender system in Virtual Learning Environments. My research is driven by the need for good models to evaluate the impact of new public policy in education and business. I am passionate about using data to provide solutions and answers. I teach graduate and undergraduate courses at UTB on Data Science, Quality Control and Operations Research.
