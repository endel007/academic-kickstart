abstract: "The present research article proposes a method to classify University engineering programs, placing special
attention to relations between the subjects of the curriculum and the 12 areas of knowledge established in the
body of competencies published by the Institute of industrial and System Engineers (IIES). Techniques of
unsupervised data analysis such as Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis were used for
the proposed classification. Twenty-one programs, accredited by high quality in Industrial Engineering in
Colombia, are used as units of study. The results show that factors such as international accreditation, size of
the faculties of engineering and University profile, influence the grouping of the programs of study. The
research allowed to classify three large main components and profiles of accredited programs."
